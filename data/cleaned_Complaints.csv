If a customer calls the helpline and requests a specific male or female supervisor, inform them that only a LIVE CALL can be transferred to an available supervisor. If the customer has a specific genuine issue previously discussed with a particular supervisor, follow the same handling procedure and inform the customer that only LIVE CALLS can be transferred to an available supervisor.

Relevant ISMS must be sent after each attempt. ISMS Guidelines for Follow-up Attempts: If contact is not established during follow-up: ""Dear Customer, we are trying to contact you with respect to your complaint/query at 111 helpline. We will call you again. Thank you."" If contact is not established after the 3rd attempt (closing activity): ""Dear Customer, we are unable to contact you. You are requested to dial 111 for further assistance."" Mandatory Prefix Usage in Every Attempt: CN (Connected Case) : Example: ""CN - Called the customer and guided about XYZ, etc."" NOC (Not Connected Case): Example: ""NOC - Number power off and could not contact the customer."" NCR (No Contact Required) : Example: ""NCR - Callback not required for XYZ (DNB, marketing-related cases, etc.).""

Customers must be informed accordingly. If a call drops during a live call transfer or on hold, the TL must call the customer back regardless of the cut-off time. If the customer insists on an immediate call back after 9:30 PM, the TL will call back the customer. If a customer calls from another NDC, the agent will create a case using a dummy number in SuperOffice but enter the customer's problematic number in the Title field of the case.

Scenario 1: It has been observed that when customers are using American handsets and after updating of software, it adds 11 before number. In this case SMS is successfully sent (also visible in Usage ) but not received at  party B end. If customer confirms  such a case where customer’s handset is appending “11” as prefix, ask customer to check if “11” is being appended only when customer sends message to B-Party who’s number is saved in his/her contact list or when he/she manually types the B-Party number for SMS. Remedy: If error is true where customer is sending message to saved list then guide customer to re-build his/her contact list . Second remedy is to ask customer to factory reset handset or downgrade its software for issue resolution. Important: “Please ensure that re-building of contact list is always guided before asking customer to downgrade handsets Software ”. Common Example of American handsets are; (Motorola XT1585/Motorola Droid Turbo 2, Motorola KF12937145/Motorola XT1662/Motorola Moto M, Motorola XT1254/Motorola XT1250 etc) Scenario 2: In case customer claims sending SMS but it’s not received at party B end,  there is a possibility of improper Service Center Number saved in customer’s handset;  this error can be modified after software/firmware upgrade. However, in case where Service Center Number is not properly saved , It is observed that there will be no record/CDR  generated due to invalid SC-number where no message is submitted to SMSC. Remedy: In this case please guide customer to modify the Service Center Number to “92300000042” or simply “ 92300” by checking through the settings of its default messaging App in handset.

For OMNO merchant, loan limit is determined only on JazzCash account usage. Loan limit will increase with increase in JazzCash account usage.

15986,15985,Jazz,SMS Outgoing-ROX,In case customer complaints for SMS Outgoing issue then we will follow below guidelines. Handling also includes SMS spamming restoration,1044,A,37:51.6,Complaint,nan,18,nan,nan,nan,For SMS Complaint : Go to super office → search customer number and create case → Type: Cellular Complaint Area: SMS outgoing Sub Area: Outgoing SMS - Jazz to Jazz / Outgoing SMS - Jazz to OMO etc,"Number should be active Number of B Party: Duration of Complaint City Confirm if Party B is receiving SMS from all other numbers Error Message (Sending failed/Unable to send, Messages are sent but not received on a number: Confirm if Party B is receiving SMS from all other numbers) Known Issue on Konnect T ake the Country Code from CSRTB → Consumption window → Usage Step 2 : Agent will search this particular country code from Konnect Step 3 : If there is Open trouble ticket in Konnect then agent will not acknowledge the complaints and will guide customer as per normal SOP (Punching of work code is mandatory in this case) Step 4: If there is closed ticket then agent will consult Konnect for coverage status For complaints where customer claims  that they are successfully sending SMS but SMS is not received party B end. Scenario 1: It has been observed that when customers are using American handsets and after updating of software, it adds 11 before number. In this case SMS is successfully sent (also visible in Usage ) but not received at  party B end. If customer confirms  such a case where customer’s handset is appending “11” as prefix, ask customer to check if “11” is being appended only when customer sends message to B-Party who’s number is saved in his/her contact list or when he/she manually types the B-Party number for SMS. Remedy: If error is true where customer is sending message to saved list then guide customer to re-build his/her contact list . Second remedy is to ask customer to factory reset handset or downgrade its software for issue resolution. Important: “Please ensure that re-building of contact list is always guided before asking customer to downgrade handsets Software ”. Common Example of American handsets are; (Motorola XT1585/Motorola Droid Turbo 2, Motorola KF12937145/Motorola XT1662/Motorola Moto M, Motorola XT1254/Motorola XT1250 etc) Scenario 2: In case customer claims sending SMS but it’s not received at party B end,  there is a possibility of improper Service Center Number saved in customer’s handset;  this error can be modified after software/firmware upgrade. However, in case where Service Center Number is not properly saved , It is observed that there will be no record/CDR  generated due to invalid SC-number where no message is submitted to SMSC. Remedy: In this case please guide customer to modify the Service Center Number to “92300000042” or simply “92300” by checking through the settings of its default messaging App in handset. Scenario 3: There are situations where outgoing SMS issue is related to Anti-spamming policy which can be handled upfront by frontend agents with proper probing. It has been observed that customers are complaining about outgoing SMS issue, when customers are sending same text/content on different numbers which exceeds allowed Limits on Jazz network. Example:  “Good Morning” send to 400 contacts in 15 mins, this is spamming. Remedy: If customer message exceed the limit, message will reject by anti-spam.

17774,17773,Jazz,JazzCash – Customer Account – Account Opening Unikrew Enablement – SOP,"This SOP document outlines the revised Customer Account Opening journey details. According to SBP guidelines, users must complete biometric verification (BVS) during the registration process to confirm their identity. If a user fails to perform the BVS while creating account, they will be registered as an L0 customer. L0 customers are restricted from performing debit transactions but can still perform credit transactions. All newly registered L0 accounts through app will have a 'Debit Lock Rule Profile' applied, allowing credit transactions while blocking debit transactions. Upon logging in, L0 customers will receive a notification prompting them to complete BVS to unlock full account services. Once the customer completes BVS, their account will be upgraded, and full transaction capabilities, including debit transactions, will be restored. No complaints will be logged for errors related to debit transaction failures for L0 customers. Instead, customers will be advised to complete BVS and try again.
